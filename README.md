*For this study, our objectives are to:*

- Identify and visualize the factors that contribute to customer churn.
- Develop a prediction model that will:
    - Classify whether a customer is likely to churn or not.
    - Ideally, generate a probability of churn to facilitate targeted customer service efforts in preventing churn, based on the model's performance.
    
The dataset is from Kaggle.

ML algorithms utilized in this study:
- Decision Tree, Random Forest
- Linear Regressor (primal and with 2nd degree polynomial)
- SVM Classifier (RBF and Polynomial Kernel)
- XGBOOST Classifier
